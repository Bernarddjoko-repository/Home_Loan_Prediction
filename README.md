ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting loan default risk using machine learning techniques. Financial institutions need accurate models to assess credit risk and minimize losses due to loan defaults. We built and evaluated multiple modelsâ€”including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoostâ€”to determine the best-performing model for predicting loan status.

ðŸš€ Goal: Develop a robust classification model that helps lenders decide whether to approve or reject loan applications based on risk assessment.
